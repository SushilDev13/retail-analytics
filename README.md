# Retail Analytics & Uplift Testing

Analysis of customer purchasing behavior and store layout impact using real retail transaction data. Built to support data-driven product placement, promotional targeting, and in-store experiments.

## Problem Statement
Retailer lacks clear visibility into:
- Who the core snack consumers are across brands and periods (e.g., Christmas)
- Which store layouts and product positioning drive incremental sales

## Project Goals
1. Understand purchasing patterns by brand, flavour, pack size, and customer type
2. Assess layout impact using uplift testing with control/trial store framework
3. Provide commercial recommendations for seasonal strategy & store design

## Key Insights
- Kettle, Doritos, Smiths, and Pringles are top-selling chip brands
- Retirees and older families show strong seasonal loyalty
- 175g packs dominate; budget shoppers drive Pringles sales
- Store 88 layout trial showed strong sales uplift vs. control

## Programming & Data Analysis
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- A/B Testing

## Results Summary
- Sales uplift observed in Store 88 → keep new layout
- Store 86 underperformed → discontinue/test alternative
- Target retirees with pre-Christmas chip bundles ($9.99)
